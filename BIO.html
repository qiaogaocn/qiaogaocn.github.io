<p>Qiao Gao was born on July 11th, 1989 in Zhengzhou China. At the age of 3, he showed great interests on playing a DOS Pool game on the computer in his father's office. Noticing his curiosity on computers, his parents sent him to a primary school that provided PC lessons from very beginning, which was very rare at that time in China since PCs had not been widely spreaded. In school, he learnt a lot basic uses of computer, most of which are under Windows 95. Soon after that, at the age of 8, these knowledges could no longer satisfy him any more. Then his father promised him a PC at home, which was very expensive at that time. The night of that day was the first night he got insomnia in his memory. After he got his own computer, unlike others children at his age, he prefered to learn something on his own. In his primary school, he taught himself the uses of Office, Flash, Dreamweaver, Visual Basic, DOS, etc. He ran deeply into these softwares and reached the level higher than most adults at that time. From that time on, he has never stopped learning and chasing his own dream till now.</p>

<p>Aside from learning on his own, Qiao never performed any hesitation on communicating with anyone else. He was the leader of a computer league in his primary school. They had meeting everyday after school with Mr Zhang, an excellent and professional teacher in charge, discussing new technologies and solving problems together. However, this is just a beginning. In high school, during 2005 and 2008, he joined school's programing competition team, which mainly focused on Pascal.</p>

<p>Qiao was well known as a reliable tech-supporter both for teachers and students during his school life. He began to help his friends reinstall operating system since 2000, when he was just an 11 years old little boy. With no automatic processing on system installation at that time, he could modify BIOS, use floppy disk to boot, and use DOS commands such as "format" and "fdisk" easily. In school, he was an frequent visitor of teachers' office. Whenever they had troubles in sorting or functioning Excel forms, they tended to Qiao for help. In middle school, he even gave his Chinese teacher a lesson on Powerpoint when she was confused by making a slideshow for her class. Moreover, he has been  in charge of all electrical devices such as projector and camera in his classroom since his middle school age. During his graduate and undergraduate years, even among those who have the background of computer science, Qiao was still outstanding on solving actual technique problems on both daily usage and projects.</p>

<p>Merging all of himself into new technologies, aside from just reading books, Qiao keeps collecting information from everywhere he can approach. Reading through internet and magazines became his everyday hobby when he was just 10. He was a constant reader of a famous magazine in China, "Computer Amateur", for ten years and also he really liked the magazine "Populaces Hardware" and kept reading it for four years till its suspension of publication. Learning that the growing on hardware is getting even more significant and having a dream to change the world, he finally decided to study hardware design when he was accepted into the Department of Electrical Engineering of Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications(XUPT), in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, in 2008.</p>

<p>In XUPT, with passion, talent and enough background knowledge on what was taught, Qiao became one of the best students in his major with a top 5% GPA(3.7/4). Additionally, Qiao obtained the university scholarship consecutively from 2008 to 2011 and was rewarded twice as an excellent league member of the university from 2009-2011. As a student, Qiao began to study software basics(C, Assembly language), FPGA, SoC, DSP, and communication theory, under instruction of many professors, including the vice-president of electrical engineering department, Huimin Du, who led Qiao into the world of IC design and gave him great help during his college time. The knowledge attained at university has said to have been invaluable, by Qiao himself. Moreover, not necessarily seeking significant attention towards hardware design study, Qiao would like to attend any activity that interested him. In 2010, leading a three people team, Qiao attended an university wide assembly language programing competition. As the only team from a major other than software design in the final competition, they eventually got the third prize. Though worked hard for few weeks on this match, Qiao felt great excitement and happiness during the process of working with his friends. Thanks to the support from his professor and also his continuing hard working on his study, he got an A on his graduate paper,"An FPGA Implementation of Line Segment Rasterization", which was finally listed in one of the "Outstanding graduate papers" in his school, and gave his undergraduate time a perfect end.</p>

<p>Knowing that the United States is where the lasted techniques are allocated, Qiao made his mind to pursue further education abroad. By April 2012, Qiao had been accepted into Illinois Institute of Technology(IIT), Chicago, IL, USA. Nervous to leave his home country, family and friends behind, Qiao accepted the invitation to attend IIT to study advanced VLSI and SoC design, DSP architecture optimization, wireless telecommunication principle, hardware design methodology and analog IC design, under the instruction of many incredible engineers, and theory professors, such as Jafar Sanie and Erdal Oruklu. In IIT, Qiao began to deal with some really practical and challenging tasks which had raised his investigation to a higner level. Throughout his graduate years, he began to use Pspice, Cadence to do some practical designs and use matlab to do module optimizations and investigations other than just calculations. Aside from the coding job on VLSI design, Qiao began to merge himself into the details of the circuit to achieve a faster and more reliable design and concentrate more on the overlook of the whole structure of an SoC to make optimizations. With an easier access to the latest techniques all over the world, he finished several papers covering the implementations of the latest CMOS logics, DSP structures and arithmetic algorithms, the summaries of the latest design method and future trend of telecommunications such as the Internet of Things(LoT).</p>

<p>Currently, Qiao has already graduated from IIT. With all the knowledge and passion, seeing an incredibly great development in his hometown, Qiao choose to become one of those who go back to China from US, to chase the dream deep in his heart. Now he is seeking a job in China and his curiosity on new techniques is just like the very beginning and will never fade.(10/04/2014)</p>
