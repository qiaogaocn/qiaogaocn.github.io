##Introduction##
In this project, a Butterfly Fourier Algorithm is implemented in to 3*3 NoC structure. 

The challenge of this project focuses on: 

- Extend the origin design into a 3*3 NoC network. 
- Map all 14 the processes into 9 PE in total.
- Evaluate the performance of the newly built system. 

To solve these problems, methods below are used correspondingly: 

- Modify the module declaration and change the connection in top.cpp. Add y axis function to router.cpp. 
- Merge some of the functions of processes into one PE. Let the functions be determined by the coordinate of current PE and the source location of current. 
- Add counters to all the output queue to judge whether there is a stuck or not and decide the fastest rate of this system depending on the evaluate result. 

All implementation details will be served in part 3...
