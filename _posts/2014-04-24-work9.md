##Abstraction##

This paper provides an FPGA solution on line segment rasterization which separate the whole process into two modules: initial module and Bresenham module, after a deep analysis on Bresenham Algorithm. This design can be adjusted to the pipeline structure of graphic processing perfectly through which the position and parameter of every pixel can be generated by the graphic information about the vertex of the line segment. The key points of this project lie on the problem of changing the algorithm of Bresenham, initialization, interpolation into the hardware description and founding the test platform both in software and hardware scale. The features of the circuit include: get the parameters of positions and RGB from the upper circuit, save all the information, initial the line plotter through the pipeline calculate, output the raster data in series; support the pipeline structure, receive and send data through handshake protocol. The subject adopts Cyclone II series of Altera development board as hardware devices, use Verilog code drive the model to achieve the function of rasterization, use the Modelsim and Quartus II simulation software bring about the circuit simulation and verification and indicate whether the design circuits meet the requirements of line segment rasterization function.

**Key Words**: Line Segment Rasterization, Bresenham, Pipeline
