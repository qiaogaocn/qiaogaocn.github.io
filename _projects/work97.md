##Abstract##

This paper provides some implementation examples  of multi-operand adder depending on different structures. More specifically, I design an 8 operands adder with four bits for each operand on three different structures separately: Linear structure of carry propagation adder, linear model of carry save adder and tree structure multi operand adder depending on [4:2] adder. Moreover, a bonus work of a 10 4-bit operands adder is also described in this paper with the use of [5:0] adder and tree structure.  

Addition to the implementation of adder, this project also provides the result of simulation, synthesis and place and route with reports of timing efficiency, power consumption and area usage for each level of all the designs.
