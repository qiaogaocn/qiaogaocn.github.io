##Abstract##
This paper provides an overview on digital arithmetic algorithms for reciprocal, division and square root operations which have been widely used in contemporary VLSI architectures. Moreover, some implementation examples of these algorithms will also be provided and shortly described in this paper as well as some algorithm improvements that are made to speed up specific applications and make it easier to adjust to a new structure.  

The algorithms that will be introduced in this article include: SRT algorithm, Newton-Raphson(NR) Iteration and Goldschmidt method for division and square root and NR algorithm for reciprocal calculation.   

Meanwhile, the implementations for SRT and NR method will be provided as instances for these algorithms in actual usage. Then, the speed up method for Goldschmidt algorithm will be served as an example of algorithm optimization.  

In addition to the introduction of algorithms and implementations, and purpose of this paper also focuses on the thought of improvement when we make a design depending on these algorithms.   

**Keywords:** reciprocal, division, square root, SRT, Newton-Raphson, Goldschmidt.
