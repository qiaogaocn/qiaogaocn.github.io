![audioamp]({{ BASE.PATH }}/images/ece425.jpg)

Sketch and analysis using OrCAD Capture CIS Lite and Pspice.  

There are few points that have to be clarified first: 
 
- 250 Ohm is a normal resistance value for a high quality monitor level headphone. 
- The parameters of the voltage source at the input point are not certain values, may be changed during analysis.
 
More details will be given in part 2...
