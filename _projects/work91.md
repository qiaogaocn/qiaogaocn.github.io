##Abstract##

This paper introduces FPGA implementations of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) depending on Algorithm Strength Reduction and binDCT algorithm. DCT is a frequent use calculation for telecommunication and image processing. Therefore, a fast and low resource usage hardware implementation of DCT is highly demanded. In this report, specifically, an 8-input-8-output DCT module will be sketched using both Algorithm Strength Reduction and binDCT, which are all algorithms to gain low cost and high efficiency design of DCT. The function correctness of both designs will be test and a comparison between them will be made in terms of both scale and timing.

**Keywords:** FPGA, DCT, Algorithm Strength Reduction, binDCT
