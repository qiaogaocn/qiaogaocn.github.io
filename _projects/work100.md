##Abstract##
This paper provides an introduction on a latest SoC design method: configurable processor, 
which has been widely used for the sake of its lower cost, lower power consumption, higher 
efficiency for ASIC or Embedded system design and better performance in many practical application 
aspects such as video decoders and DSP. To make the overview more clear, we take Xtensa architecture 
IP core as an example to describe what a configurable processor structure is like and how it help 
designers to simplify the design flow and get approach to an even better function than before. 
Xtensa is made by Tensilica and it is one of the most popular configurable processor cores around 
the world. Xtensa architecture provides a brand new design technology for both hardware and software 
designers and it is so convenient that it leads to a great impact on SoC design since 1999 when it is 
firstly built. 

This paper will give answers to the questions below by providing details about Xtensa: 

- What is configurable processor. 
- What can a configurable processor do. 
- Why we need configurable processor in our design. 
- How it can improve the performance of our design.  

**Keywords:** Configurable, Processor, Xtensa
